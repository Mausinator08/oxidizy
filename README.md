# Oxidizy

An ambitious project to mimic the smaller things in life.

This is how I learned rust.

The idea is to build a cli tool that can generate enough life, and *sublife* (neutrons, protons, electrons), that when you give the tool atomic weights, it can "generate" appropriate elements.

Another ambitious goal, would be to set up bonding logic to create water or other compounds.

The most difficult part will be setting up an electro-magnetic field. That is why we are starting with the simplest form of an electro magnetic field.
